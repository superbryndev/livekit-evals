## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Expanded provider detection to support 25+ providers including:
  - **LLM**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta (Llama), Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity, Groq, Together, Replicate, Hugging Face
  - **TTS**: ElevenLabs, Cartesia, PlayHT, Resemble, Murf, WellSaid, Speechify, Sarvam, Azure, AWS Polly, Google Cloud
  - **STT**: Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Rev, Speechmatics, Gladia
  - **Realtime**: LiveKit, Twilio, Vonage
- Support for custom telephony rates via `call_rate_usd` parameter:
  - Pass custom telephony rate per minute ($/min) to `create_webhook_handler()`
  - Automatically included in cost calculations
  - Overrides default provider costs when provided
  - Useful for custom telephony providers (Twilio, Vonage, etc.)

### Fixed
- Added missing `tts_voice_id` field to `usage_metrics` dictionary initialization to prevent KeyError when extracting TTS voice configuration
- Improved `tts_voice_id` extraction with fallback to use `tts_model` when no explicit voice_id attribute exists (common for providers like Sarvam where model name IS the voice)

### Planned
- CLI tool for testing webhook connectivity
- Custom webhook URL configuration
- Retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
